# Stage Management App

This is my first app, which I am using to learn HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to help drama teachers keep track of rehearsals. Currently, it's only
functionality is splitting up scenes, so that multiple groups can rehearse at the same time.

## How it Works

On the left side of the screen, we have the main character list. On the right side, we have the scene list.

If one teacher is working with a group of characters (say, LONNY, DREW and DENNIS) then they select those names in the
left hand column. This will remove all scenes with those characters from the right hand column, leaving all the scenes
that can be rehearsed with other characters. This is a fast way to be able to figure out what groups of characters can
be rehearsing together at the same time. It should eliminate any time spent rifling through script pages to figure out
how to be making better use of time.

## Features to Come...

In time, I would like to add color coding for scenes - showing which scenes have been blocked and which scenes have been
rehearsed. This would then form a color-coded overview of the whole play, so that, if there are multiple drama teachers,
everyone can see what sections of the play need to be worked on.

Also, I would like to add a prop-list monitor. This would allow the user to input a list of all props required and "place" them on Stage Left Wing or Stage Right Wing. The purpose of this is to allow a stage manager to virtually build the technical aspects of the show, before they enter the space. A user will also be able to track where a prop is brought on and off, what props require resetting, refilling, etc., and perhaps info on where the prop came from, if it is on loan...

There are lots of other features that I would like to add as I go on. At the moment, this is just a fun exercise to see if I can create the functionality for all these aspects of the app.

Any thoughts, suggestions, or criticisms are welcome. It's all about learning, improving, and (hopefully) creating something which will be of use to people in the theatre industry.
